# Workout App

A React-based workout application built to demonstrate practical frontend development skills, with a strong focus on state management, component architecture, and UI design. This project was developed as an early portfolio piece to showcase real-world React patterns and clean, maintainable code.

# Goals

- Demonstrate effective global state management using React Context
- Build a realistic, production-style UI using custom CSS
- Consume and display data from an external API for gym exercises
- Design features that mirror real fitness applications

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped using **Vite** to provide a fast development environment for the build tooling. Run this project by running the following:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- **React** - Component based UI development
- **Vite** - Modern build tool and development server
- **React Context API** - Used for global state management
- **React Hooks** - useState, useContext
- **CSS modules** - maintainable independent component styling for styling
- **Fitness REST API** - Used to fetch gym exercises and relevant data

## Core Features

1. Exercise Search & Information

- Fetches exercise data from an external fitness API
- Search functionality to quickly find specific exercises
- Detailed exercise views explaining how each movement is performed

2. Custom Workout Routines

- Users can create and manage their own workout routines
- State-driven UI updates for adding and removing exercises

3. Authentication (Mocked)

- Fake authentication system implemented using React Context
- Lays the groundwork for real authentication and persistence

### (In Development)

4. Real user authentication with persistent storage
5. Saving of workout routines
6. Exercise history page to track previously completed workouts

## Key Learnings

This project highlights my ability to:

- Structure a React application using scalable patterns
- Manage both local and global state effectively
- Build UI without relying on component libraries
- Integrate external APIs into a clean user experience
